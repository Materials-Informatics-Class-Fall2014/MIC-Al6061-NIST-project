EBSD data are collected for As-Recived, and heat treated ones at 400, 525, 650, and 775 F

**Here are collcetd data:**

**IPF maps of AR, 400, 525, 650, 775 Samples**

**Pole figures related to each sample are shown below:** Pole figures show that not a dramatic change in texture happened during aging process
