# Tensile results of Al-6061 for different over-aging temperatures #
Specimens from a 1 inch thick **Al-6061 T6 plate** were mechanically tested with the tensile direction oriented in the **rolling (RD), transverse (TD), and 45 degrees** directions. Samples aged for 2 hours at **400, 525, 650, and 775 F** were tested in the RD direction. The main property of interest was yield strength.

## Test Procedure Notes ##
**ASTM E8-13a** was followed as closely as possible. **Round specimens with a diameter of 0.25 inches and gage section of 1 inch were used.** A screw type machine was used with threaded grips, a 200 kips load cell, and a 1 inch clip gage. The machine was run at a constant cross head speed to achieve a **strain rate of 0.005 in/in /s.** A pre-load of 20 lbs was used. The clip gage was removed when it reached a displacement of 0.098 inches. The test was continued until failure for all cases except in the aged specimens at 775 F which never failed. Five tests were run for each condition. 
 
***Known problem:** The clip gage was attached with rubber bands and double sided tape was used to minimize slipping; however, it was difficult to reduce the gage drifting. This caused high variability and incorrect values for the Young's modulus.*  
***Solution:** Zero the gage before attaching to the sample to maintain an accurate gage length of 1 inch. Use double sided carbon tape. In addition to rubberbands, use a small bungee around the center of the gage to stabilize it. When the pin is removed, the clip gage should not have changed more than ~0.1% strain. Discard tests with incorrect Modulus.*

## Analysis Notes ##
- Young's Modulus was determined from a linear fit of a region of the initial data. The strain was shifted so that the modulus line went through zero.  
- An 0.2% offset strain was used to determine Yield Strength.
- The ultimate tensile strength was taken as the maximum engineering stress.  
- Strain <= 9.8% was determined from the clip gage. Strain > 9.8% was determined using the machine displacement. This is a pretty good approximation because the relationship between the clip gage strain and machine displacement is ~1 as the strain approaches 9.8%.
- A short program in Matlab was used to analyze the data.

## Results ##
Each test has the stress-strain curves saved as an image and a data file saved as an excel spreadsheet.

A summary of the results is below (Average/ Standard Deviation)
