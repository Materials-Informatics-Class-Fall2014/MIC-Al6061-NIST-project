### EBSD datasets for As-Recived, and heat treated ones at 400, 525, 650, and 775 F

**Here are collcetd data:**

**IPF maps of AR, 400, 525, 650, 775 Samples**

**Pole figures related to each sample are shown below:** Pole figures show that not a dramatic change in texture happened during aging process

* Max value for AR: 2.819
* Max value for 400: 2.408
* Max value for 525: 2.769
* Max value for 650: 2.432
* Max value for 775: 2.696

Here is an example of **Grain Size** distribution for As-Received sample

The GS distribution is from large maps which contains about 75 smaller scans. When TSl software put these smaller maps together it cannot take care of merging grains at the edge of scan. Since the scan area is large there is an artifitial change in orientation because of tilted beam. 

Here is an example of the issue:

**TSL software splits grains at the edge of each scan, This is a Grain ID map of two scanned areas**

### Next Steps
1. Fix the issue in attaching EBSD batches
2. 2-point spatial statistics on percipitates using either SEM or OM images
