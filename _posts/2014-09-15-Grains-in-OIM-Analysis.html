# OIM Analysis #
Orientation Image Microscopy (OIM) Anaysis software is used to analyze Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) data. The data collection and analysis software is a commercial package from [EDAX-TSL](http://www.edax.com/Products/EBSD/OIM-Data-Analysis-Microstructure-Analysis.aspx). One important feature of the analysis is grain size.

# Grain Size Analysis #

## Grain Size Parameters ##

First off the data can be understood as pixels. Each pixel has an orientation and physical scale associated with it. In order to define a grain, a **grain tolerance angle** needs to be specified. This angle is the allowable misorientation between neighboring pixels. Secondly in order to avoid counting noise in the data as grains, a **minimum grain size** is also specified.

The defaults are 5 degrees and 2 microns respectively.

### Misorientation ###
Misorientation refers to the rotation required to bring Grain A into coincidence with Grain B. The description can be made as an axis-angle pair, Rodrigues Vector, or with Bunger-Euler angles. Most times, only the angle from the axis-angle pair is considered, and the minimum angle (multiple axis-angle pairs can accomplish AB coincidence) is used.

## Grain Size Formula
The default grain size calculation is to insert the area of the grain into the equation for area of a circle. From this the equivalent diameter can be found.

### Grain Shape ###
The most you can do here is treating the grain as an oval. The major and minor axes can be calculated as the max and min chord lengths or through a least squares fit to the equation of an oval.
