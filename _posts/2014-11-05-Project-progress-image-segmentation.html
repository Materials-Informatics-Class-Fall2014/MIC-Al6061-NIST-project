# Image segmentation on SEM images #
- The grayscale image from SEM were processed by microscope image processing tool to get RGB images

## Here is an example of RGB images from SEM. The left images is from SE detector and the righ one is from BSE detector##

Since the BSE image provide higher contrast we decided o work on BSE images

## Image segmentaion with choosing 30 peaks##

Pixels which fall in phase 22 and 30 are plotted in the following images
