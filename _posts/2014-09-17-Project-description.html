# Project Goals#

To find microstructure-Property-Process relations in aging of Al6061 alloy during which grain structure, texture, and precipitate structure evolve. 

Microstructural features of impact exist at different length scales within the material. For this materials system of interest namely the Al-Mg-Si system and specifically 6061 alloy, the primary microstructural features that will impact properties are:

**Coherent GP zones and semi-coherent precipitate particles** . These precipitate phases can be revealed by transmission electron microscopy. Key features of each different precipitate phase (mean, std. deviation, and ideally the full distribution) are:

* Volume fraction
* Size (nm)
* Aspect ratio
* Spacing (nm)

These are examples of TEM images of these particles

**Al-Fe-Si-type constituent particles** . the constituent particles are best revealed by optical metallography both in the as-polished and etched conditions. Again the key microstructural features of interest (mean, std. deviation, and ideally the full distribution) are:

* Volume fraction
* Size (microns)
* Aspect ratio
* Spacing (microns)

These are examples of optical image of these particles

Also BSE detector in SEM can reveal these particles in better contrast and resolution

**Grain structure, including degree of recrystallization and texture** . Grain structure can be revealed by optical metallography with suitable etching and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Crystallographic texture is measured using electron back scattered detection (EBSD) technique. Texture parameters of interest are the strengths of different texture orientations, typically represented in a pole figure. For recrystallized grain structures, the key features (mean, std. deviation, and ideally the full distribution) are:

* Size (microns)
* Aspect ratio
* the strengths of different texture orientations

# Source of Datasets#

* EBSD datasets, optical, and SEM images are collected for a project sponsored by NIST

This is an EBSD datasets for as-received sample and associated pole figures

# Details of Datasets##

* A set of samples heat treated at different temperatures (as received, 400, 525, 650, 775 F)
* EBSD datasets are collected from RD of samples at different heat treating conditions of temperature
*	Optical and SEM images of precipitates are collected at different heat treating conditions of temperature
* Mechanical tensile tests are done for each heat treating condition.
* Macroindentation datasets at each heat treating condition.

# Proposed Workflow##

* Extract structure data from collected EBSD, optical and SEM datasets for each heat treating condition
**	Volume fraction, Size, Aspect ratio, Spacing of precipitates
**	Size, morphology, and texture of microstructure for grains
**	Generate statistics from structure data 
**	Establish process-structure linkages for this system
