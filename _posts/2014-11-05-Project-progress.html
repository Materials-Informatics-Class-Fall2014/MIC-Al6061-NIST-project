# Project progress #
- **EBSD calibration got fixed** and new EBSD scans were collected for as-received sample and ones aged at 400, 525, 650, 775 F for 2hrs
    - In new EBSD data, grains at the edge of each small batch are correctly identified and as a result of that edge grains merge perfectly to their other part in neighboring scan batch.
- **EBSD date were analyzed** to extract texture and grain structure information:
    - Grain size distribution plots
    - Grain aspect ratio plots
    - Pole figure 
    - ODF (orientation distribution function) plots


## Inverse pole figure map ##

An inverse pole figure shows the position of a sample direction relative to the crystal reference frame. In terms of IPF map in EBSD, each color represent three euler angle that transform the sample frame to the crystal frame.

Here are IPF maps for as-received sample and ones aged at 400, 525, 650, 775 F for 2hrs:


## Grain size distribution##
Grain size distribution is calculated in OIM software based on equivalent diameter values. The equivalent diameter is the diameter of a circle that gives the same area as the one for that grain. 

Here are GS distribution plots for as-received sample and ones aged at 400, 525, 650, 775 F for 2hrs:


##Grain aspect ratio distribution##
One measure of the shape of grains in EBSD scan is the aspect ratio. The aspect ratio is defined as the length of the minor axis divided by the length of the major axis and thus ranges from 0 to 1

Here are Aspect ratio distribution plots for as-received sample and ones aged at 400, 525, 650, 775 F for 2hrs:

## Pole figure ##
Pole figure is a means of displaying crystallographic texture. A pole figure shows the position of a pole (a normal to a lattice plane) relative to the sample reference frame. 

Here are PF plots for as-received sample and ones aged at 400, 525, 650, 775 F for 2hrs:


## Orientation distibution function (ODF) ##

The full 3D representation of crystallographic texture is given by the orientation distribution function (ODF). The ODF is defined as the volume fraction of grains with a certain orientation **g**.

Here are ODF plots for as-received sample and ones aged at 400, 525, 650, 775 F for 2hrs:
