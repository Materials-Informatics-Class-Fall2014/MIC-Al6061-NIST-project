# Microstructure Analysis of Al-6061: Description #
*Authors: Jordan Weaver, Ali Khosravani*

# Assumptions #

## Salient features ##
- Grain size, shape, and distribution (regions of uniform crystal orientation)
- Texture (a high degree of probability of specific crystal orientations over random)
- Constituent particle size, shape, distribution, and spacing (never were dissolved)
- Precipitate size, distribution, and spacing (dissolved and precipitate out of the matrix)

## Data Collection ##
- EBSD to measure grain size and texture
- Optical and SEM-BSE for constituent particles
- SEM-BSE and TEM for precipitates

## Schematic of grains, particles, and precipitates ##

Example EBSD Grain Map of Al-6061. Regions of uniform color are individual grains. See this [post](http://alikhosravani.github.io/MIC-Al6061-NIST-project/2014/09/15/Grains-in-OIM-Analysis.html) for how OIM Data Analysis defines grains and other measurements.
